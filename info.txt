Relations

data structure for a family of 4

member_1 male 
member_2 female
member_3 male
member_4 male

member_2 is WIFE of member_1
member_1 is FATHER of member_3
member_2 is MOTHER of member_3
member_1 is FATHER of member_4
member_2 is MOTHER of member_4
member_3 is BROTHER of member_4

relation of each new member is added to existing family members

Problem:
member_3 gets married to m5
Now member m5 is WIFE of m3

m5 now has indirect relation to m1,m2,m4
which can be traversed through m3 but it is not saved in db

so basically we only save direct relations
what are direct relations
spouses, children, parents
